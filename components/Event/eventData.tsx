        "On November 3, 2023, the members of IEEE HKN Nu Eta Chapter, along with members of Sairam Unnat Bharat Abhiyan, conducted a village survey to one of the adopted villages of Sri Sairam Engineering College, Varadharajapuram. The students were divided into teams and conducted a survey of the village people, identifying all the societal and communal problems they faced. The primary purpose of this survey was to provide engineering and technological solutions to these problems and implement those projects after receiving funding from IEEE. Implementing these projects will be highly beneficial to the village residents.",

              <div><strong>KEY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SESSION:</strong></div>
              <div>The two-day hands-on training event on Web Development for high school girls, organized by the IEEE HKN Nu Eta Chapter of Sri Sairam Engineering College, included several key sessions designed to empower participants and encourage their involvement in STEM-related activities. The event began with an introduction to HTML basics, covering tags, attributes, and syntax, enabling participants to create a basic HTML structure for a webpage. Hands-on sessions involved tasks such as adding images, links, and text content to create basic web pages. The participants also created their own login pages using HTML, learning to add basic form elements, styles, and validation. Students had the freedom to design their own websites, unleashing their creativity. CSS basics were introduced, teaching participants how to style their websites using selectors, properties, and values. JavaScript basics were also covered, allowing students to add interactivity to their websites and understand their functionality. Additionally, an introduction to no-code web development platforms and tools provided insights into building web applications without writing code. The event concluded with prize distribution, recognizing the volunteers and awarding prizes to winners of various activities and challenges. Fun activities were conducted throughout the sessions to keep the students engaged and motivated.</div>

  <h1>NUMINDS TUTORING – NAVIGATE TO NEW HEIGHTS</h1>
  <h2>EMPOWER & EXCEL: MASTERING IN IEEE EPICS & TECH4GOOD APPLICATIONS</h2>

  <p>
    On March 6, 2025, the IEEE Product Safety Engineering Society organized a highly interactive online workshop titled
    “Empower & Excel: Mastering IEEE EPICS & Tech4Good Applications”, aimed at first-year students from all departments of
    Sri Sairam Engineering College. This knowledge-driven session served as a bridge between technical learning and social impact,
    highlighting the power of engineering solutions in addressing real-world challenges.
  </p>

  <img src="/images/events/14/s2.jpg" alt="Workshop Poster">

  <p>
    The event commenced at 6:30 PM IST and was graced by expert speakers and IEEE HKN Nu Eta Chapter members Mr. Raghul D
    and Mr. Arul Prakasam M. Mr. Raghul began with an overview of IEEE's global vision, professional development opportunities,
    and its pivotal role in connecting academia with industry. The participants were introduced to key programs including
    IEEE Tech4Good and EPICS in IEEE, which support student-driven initiatives that create a positive social impact in collaboration
    with NGOs.
  </p>

  
  <p>
    Mr. Arul Prakasam led the final segment of the workshop, focusing on structured proposal writing, NGO collaboration, budgeting,
    and aligning projects with humanitarian goals. Real-time case studies and examples of successful initiatives further enriched
    the learning experience for students, sparking active engagement and thought-provoking questions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The event concluded with an interactive Q&A session, during which students clarified their doubts on proposal documentation,
    funding structure, and the societal impact of IEEE-led projects. The speakers emphasized the importance of combining technical
    expertise with empathy, thus motivating attendees to contribute to technology-for-good initiatives under IEEE.
  </p>

  <p>
    This workshop laid a strong foundation for young minds to explore IEEE’s humanitarian technologies and inspired them to become
    proactive contributors to their communities.

  <h1>Nu Minds Tutoring – Python Unplugged</h1>
  <h2>Casual, Fun & Hands-on Learning</h2>

  <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
  <p>
    The objective of the Nu Minds Python Tutoring sessions was to equip students with a strong foundation in Python programming, 
    nurture problem-solving skills, and demonstrate how coding can be both practical and enjoyable. 
    The sessions aimed to build confidence in writing programs while encouraging students to think logically and creatively.
  </p>

  <h3>EVENT OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p>
    The Python Tutoring program kickstarted on 15th September 2025 with an overwhelming response from first-year students, 
    drawing consistent participation throughout the 5-day journey. Conducted online via Google Meet by 
    <b>Prahaladhan J</b> from the CSE department, the sessions turned out to be one of the most engaging and impactful 
    initiatives under the Nu Minds Tutoring banner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike a conventional lecture-style class, the Python sessions were highly interactive, fun, and application-oriented. 
    Students didn’t just listen—they coded along, solved exercises in real-time, and shared their outputs during the sessions. 
    The balance of concept clarity, coding demonstrations, and hands-on practice made the learning experience both refreshing and effective.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the end of the program, many students expressed that Python felt less like a subject and more like a skill 
    they could instantly apply to their academic and personal projects.
