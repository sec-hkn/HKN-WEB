The students were divided into teams and conducted a survey of the village people, identifying all the societal and communal problems they faced. The primary purpose of this survey was to provide engineering and technological solutions to these problems and implement those projects after receiving funding from IEEE. Implementing these projects will be highly beneficial to the villageÂ residents.",
